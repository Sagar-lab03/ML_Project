This components are like all the modules that we are probably going to create right like initially we'll
probably create process called as data ingestion.

Data Ingestion basically means I'll be reading a dataset from a database or it can be from some other file
locations or it can be from different kind of databases also.

So initially we need to read the d.b. so that d.b. reading the data from a specific d.b., we specially say it as data injection, 
so data injection is a part of module that probably developing the entire project right.
